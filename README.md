# IBM-Consumer-Complaint-Classification-Modeling
Class group project for Practicum in Large Scale Data in collaboration with IBM

  + Collaborated with IBM to conduct Natural Language Processing project using Consumer Complaint Database as class project.
  + Built bidirectional LSTM model in Python to predict product categories of complaints on consumer financial products.
  + Achieved accuracy of 72% and weighted average of f1 of 71% classifying submission issues into 47 categories.
  + Full analysis of the project including results from additional models and further steps for possible improvements can be found in presentation slides.

The data used for this project come from [Consumer Complaint Database](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/). The model was trained and tested in Google Colab GPU using the same lines of code.
