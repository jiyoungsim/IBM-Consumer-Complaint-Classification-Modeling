# IBM-Consumer-Complaint-Classification-Modeling
Class project for Practicum in Large Scale Data in collaboration with IBM

+ Collaborated with IBM to conduct Natural Language Processing project using Consumer Complaint Database as class group project. The model contributed to simplification of the complaint submission process for consumer financial products by classifying comments by product category.
+ Cleaned and preprocessed text data using nltk module and pretrained FastText word vectors.
+ Built a bidirectional LSTM model in Python and achieved accuracy of 72% and weighted average of f1 of 71%, classifying submission issues into 47 categories.
+ Presented purpose, results, and suggestions for improvement of the project to convey business value of the model.
+ Full analysis of the project including results from additional models and further steps for possible improvements can be found in presentation slides.

The data used for this project come from [Consumer Complaint Database](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/). The model was trained and tested in Google Colab GPU using the same lines of code.
